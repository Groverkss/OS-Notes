# OS Notes

This repo contains my notes for the course OSTEP by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau.

## Contributing

There are a lot of typos in the notes as I wrote them alongside reading the
book and watching the lectures. Pull requests to fix these typos are very
appreciated.

I prefer to follow 80 character limit as a soft limit, so please make sure
to format it correctly when contributing.

## TODO

- Add Notes for Persistence
